## Overview ✨

Reppo.Exchange enables:
- **Intent-Based Data Access**: AI agents broadcast Requests for Data (RFDs) that solver nodes fulfill
- **Decentralized MCP Network**: Distributed network of solver nodes providing MCP-compliant data services
- **Permissionless Participation**: Join the network by staking a Reppo Solver NFT
- **Token Incentives**: Earn $REPPO tokens for fulfilling RFDs
- **Standardized Integration**: MCP protocol ensures consistent data access across the network

The Solver Node performs these key functions:
1. **RFD Processing**: Listens for and processes Requests for Data on the blockchain
2. **MCP Integration**: Connects to MCP servers to fulfill data requests
3. **Data Generation/Querying**: Uses MCP tools (like DynamoDB) to generate or query data
4. **NFT Verification**: Ensures node operator owns a Reppo Solver NFT
5. **Solution Submission**: Submits verified solutions to the Reppo Exchange

The Reppo Solver Node is a key participant in this ecosystem, performing the following tasks:

1. **Listening for RFDs**: Monitors the Reppo Exchange smart contract for new RFD events.
2. **Generating Datasets**: Uses a data generation service (e.g., Two Ligma server) to create synthetic or real datasets that meet RFD specifications.
3. **Uploading to IPFS**: Stores datasets on IPFS via Pinata for decentralized, persistent storage.
4. **Verifying NFT Ownership**: Ensures the node operator owns a Reppo Node NFT, which is required to participate in the network.
5. **Submitting Solutions**: Submits the IPFS URI of the dataset to the Reppo Exchange smart contract for validation and reward distribution.

The Solver Node is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to integrate with various data sources, such as Vana (Data DAOs), self-hosted LLMs, OpenGradient (synthetic data), or enterprise datasets.

## Architecture 🏗️

The Reppo Solver Node is built as a Python application with a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components. This design ensures maintainability, scalability, and flexibility for integrating with different data sources and blockchain networks.
The Solver Node implements a modular architecture designed for the decentralized MCP network:

### Components

The Solver Node consists of the following key components, each implemented in a dedicated Python module:

1. **RFDListener (`rfdListener.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Listens for `RFDPosted` events on the Reppo Exchange
   - **Functionality**: 
     - Monitors blockchain for new RFDs
     - Parses RFD intents (data requirements)
     - Routes to appropriate solver components
   - **Dependencies**: `web3.py`, `python-dotenv`

2. **DataSolver (`datasolver/`)**
   - **Purpose**: MCP-compliant data generation and querying
   - **Functionality**: 
     - **MCP Provider**: Primary provider for production
       - DynamoDB Tool: Query and generate data from DynamoDB
       - Extensible for additional MCP tools
     - **HuggingFace Provider**: For AI-powered generation
     - **Mock Provider**: For testing and development
   - **Dependencies**: `mcp-sdk`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`

3. **IPFSUploader (`ipfsUploader.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Uploads datasets to IPFS for decentralized storage.
   - **Functionality**: Uses the Pinata API to pin files to IPFS, returning an `ipfs://<CID>` URI. Handles file uploads securely with API key authentication.
   - **Dependencies**: `requests`, `python-dotenv`.

4. **NFTAuthorizer (`nftAuthorizer.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies that the node operator's wallet owns a Reppo Node NFT, which is required to submit solutions.
   - **Functionality**: Queries an ERC-721 NFT contract using `web3.py` to check the `balanceOf` the wallet address. Supports block-specific queries for historical ownership verification.
   - **Dependencies**: `web3.py`, `python-dotenv`.

5. **SolutionSubmitter (`submitSolution.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Submits the dataset's IPFS URI to the Reppo Exchange smart contract.
   - **Functionality**: Builds, signs, and sends a transaction to the `submitSolution` function of the smart contract, including the RFD ID and IPFS URI. Returns the transaction hash upon success.
   - **Dependencies**: `web3.py`, `python-dotenv`.

6. **SolverNode (`solverNode.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire workflow by integrating all components.
   - **Functionality**: Initializes the other components, coordinates RFD processing, and supports test and mock modes for development. In production mode, it runs the listener and processes RFDs as they arrive.
   - **Dependencies**: All other modules.

7. **Main CLI (`main.py`)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) to start the Solver Node.
   - **Functionality**: Uses the `click` library to offer options like `--test` (for testing with a sample RFD) and `--mock` (for offline testing without blockchain interactions).
   - **Dependencies**: `click`, `python-dotenv`.

### Workflow

1. **RFD Detection & Intent Processing**:
   - Listener detects `RFDPosted` event
   - Extracts RFD intent (data requirements)
   - Validates NFT ownership

2. **MCP Tool Selection**:
   - Analyzes RFD requirements
   - Selects appropriate MCP tool (e.g., DynamoDB)
   - Configures tool parameters

3. **Data Generation/Querying**:
   - Production: Uses MCP tools for real data
   - Test: Uses HuggingFace for AI generation
   - Mock: Generates synthetic data

3. **Dataset Generation**:
   - The `DataSolver` uses the configured data provider to generate a dataset matching the RFD schema.
   - Supported providers include HuggingFace, Mock, OpenGradient, MCP, and LocalLLM.
   - The dataset is saved locally as `data/rfd_<rfd_id>_solution.json`.

4. **IPFS Upload**:
   - The `IPFSUploader` uploads the dataset to IPFS via Pinata, returning an `ipfs://<CID>` URI.

5. **Solution Submission**:
   - The `SolutionSubmitter` builds a transaction to call the `submitSolution` function on the Reppo Exchange smart contract, passing the RFD ID and IPFS URI.
   - The transaction is signed with the private key (`PRIVATE_KEY`) and sent to the Ethereum network.
   - The transaction hash is logged for tracking.

6. **Completion**:
   - If successful, the dataset is available on the Reppo Exchange for validation and reward distribution.
   - The Solver Node continues listening for new RFDs.

The Solver Node supports three distinct modes of operation, each designed for different use cases:

### 1. Production Mode (Default)
```bash
python main.py start
```
- **Purpose**: Run the full node in production
- **Behavior**:
  - Listens for RFDs on the blockchain
  - Uses real data generation (HuggingFace if available)
  - Performs real blockchain interactions
  - Requires all environment variables
- **Use Case**: Running the actual node in production

### 2. Test Mode
```bash
python main.py start --test
```
- **Purpose**: Test the data generation pipeline
- **Behavior**:
  - Processes a sample RFD file (`sample_rfd.json` by default)
  - Uses real data generation (HuggingFace if available)
  - Skips blockchain interactions
  - Only requires `WALLET_ADDRESS` and optionally `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`
- **Use Case**: Testing data generation logic without blockchain dependencies
- **Custom RFD File**: Use `--rfd-file path/to/rfd.json` to specify a different RFD file

### 3. Mock Mode
```bash
python main.py start --mock
```
- **Purpose**: Simulate the entire pipeline for development
- **Behavior**:
  - Uses mock data generation
  - Uses mock blockchain responses
  - No external services required

## Example RFD 📊

Below is an example RFD for synthetic weather data, which the Solver Node can process:

```json
{
    "rfd_id": "sf_weather_may_aug_001",
    "name": "Synthetic Weather Data for San Francisco (May to August)",
    "description": "A synthetic dataset containing daily weather information for San Francisco from May to August, including temperature, humidity, and precipitation.",
    "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "date": {
                "type": "string",
                "format": "date"
            },
            "temperature": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Average daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit"
            },
            "humidity": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Average daily humidity percentage"
            },
            "precipitation": {
                "type": "number",
                "description": "Daily precipitation in inches"
            }
        },
        "required": ["date", "temperature", "humidity", "precipitation"]
    }
}
```

When processed, the Solver Node:
- Generates a dataset matching the schema (e.g., daily weather data for May–August).
- Saves it as `data/rfd_sf_weather_may_aug_001_solution.json`.
- Uploads it to IPFS, obtaining an `ipfs://<CID>` URI.
- Submits the URI to the Reppo Exchange smart contract if the wallet owns a Reppo Node NFT.
